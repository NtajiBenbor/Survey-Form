# 2. Why did i build this :question:

The aim of this project was to test my HTML and CSS skills. to essentailly test me knowledge and understanding of HTMl forms and its associated element, and how to style these elements using CSS properties.

# 3. What i learnt from building this project.
- How to setup HTML form Validation using " the **min and max** attributes", "the **required** attribute" and using input types such as "**email and number**".
- How to control the width of an element that has *borders* using the **"box-sizing"** property.
- How to alter the appearrance of "placeholder text" with CSS properties.
- How to center divs using a combination of the **display: block;** and the **margin: auto;** CSS properties.

# 6. Challenges :sweat:
In the process of building this project i encounterd a few challenges such as;
- I couldn't get the input boxes and the text area element to have a uniform width. I resolved this by applying the **"box-sizing"** property to the and setting the value to **"border-box"**

```CSS
top{
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 5px 0 20px 0;
    padding: 10px 10px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    border-radius: 3px;
    border: none;
    font-size: 1em;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    color: rgb(2, 0, 4);
}
```
